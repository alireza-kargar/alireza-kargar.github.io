Due to global warming and the widespread use of renewable energy, turbines are one of the attractive research areas in this field. In this regard, I researched this field in my final bachelor's project. Inspired by the concept of Savonius-type vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT), I prototyped a small wind turbine.
One of the advantages of VAWTs is that they take up less space, and because the blades are close to the center of rotation, they produce less noise than horizontal models. Also, they do not depend on the wind's direction and perform better in vortex or turbulence airflow.
On the other hand, VAWTs are usually installed where the wind speed is low, which makes the blades rotate at a lower speed, and their torque is high, which causes them to have a smaller range than horizontal axis turbines.
For this reason, we decided to design a turbine inspired by these turbines to be installed on the roof or inside the wind deflector of vehicles such as trucks to increase efficiency by being exposed to the turbulent flow.

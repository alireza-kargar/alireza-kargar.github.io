description: Interactive light modules to enhance Physical readiness
---

Today, the advancement of technology has affected every one of our daily activities. Among these activities, we can mention activities related to physical readiness because every day, many devices are introduced to the market to improve our physical condition or monitor our health. One of these tools that have become widespread is the physical readiness lights produced and sold by various companies worldwide. However, many of those are not affordable for those who live in third-world countries due to their high price. So we decided to develop and implement a cost-efficient system that all ordinary people can afford. It is called NeuroLight and was sponsored by *the Headquarters of Cognitive Sciences of Iran*.

This device used ESP32 to access the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to handle an RGB ring light, a buzzer, and an IR sensor as the ON/OFF switch, which was replaced with a touch sensor in its last version. Moreover, an Android application was developed to define several exercises and command up to 8 devices simultaneously with Bluetooth, which works on BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) mode to reduce the energy consumed by each device.

The device works by choosing the desired number of modules and connecting them to the mobile phone through the application, and you can run programs on the modules designed by experts. These programs turn the RGB ring light on and off with programmable colors with a specific sequence and delay. Also, a buzzer is embedded inside each module, so more exercises involving the sense of hearing can be done in addition to eye and body coordination.

This device's original use is to increase people's speed and agility. They can interact with the system by triggering the IR (or touch) sensor installed on the device with their hands or feet and performing the defined exercises efficiently. However, it also can be used as a rehabilitating device by senior citizens or someone with cognitive disorders to improve their body and eye coordination and have better control of movements.

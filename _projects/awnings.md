One of the topics I worked on during my bachelor's degree was automatic canopies because in my country, Iran, due to the hot and dry weather and people's interest in outdoor activities, there was a noticeable need for these products.
In those research and development projects, I researched different mechanisms, performed mechanical design calculations, and collaborated in 3D modeling and manufacturing initial prototypes, resulting in designing and implementing two awning prototypes with different design approaches.
The first prototype was a 1:10-scaled parasol inspired by the ones in the courtyard of the Masjid al-Nabi in Madinah. The difference between Masjid al-Nabi parasols and our system is the actuator. Instead of the hydraulic jack that has been used in Masjid al-Nabis parasols, we used a pulley and cable mechanism, which is actuated by a motor to open and close the umbrella links, making the system much cheaper and more reasonable.

The second prototype was a canopy designed to prevent overheating the courtyards of historical houses in tropical cities such as Yazd in Iran. In this design, the main idea was that by placing two rails along the yard's length and several wagons, the canopy fabric would cover the entire space and cast shade, which moved with cable, pulley, and winch system. As shown in the GIF below, we implemented this setting on a structure made by spaceframe profiles.
